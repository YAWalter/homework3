<h1>Why is Yonah at NJIT?</h1>
<p>Well, for starters, <b>Yonah bleeds New Jersey</b>. Originally from <a
href="http://www.hpboro.com">Highland Park, NJ</a>, when choosing schools for undergrad he was faced with the choice between
<a href="http://www.rutgers.edu">Rutgers</a> and the <a href="http://www.umd.edu">University of Maryland</a>. Heart-wrenchingly choosing to join the Terrapins, Yonah now finds himself among Highlanders once again.</p>
<h1>...but who is Yonah, anyway?</h1>
<p>After completing a Bachelors' in Communication (the people kind, not the computer kind), Yonah immediately began working
as a technical consultant, specializing in technical communication. Several development jobs later, including crash courses
in multiple coding languages, Yonah now finds himself wanting the IT <i>bona fides</i> he has lacked until now.</p>
<p>Yonah has developed user interfaces and functional code for numerous database applications, including a NASA
real-property inventory, a contract management tool, a document approvals-tracking system for the Navy, and a blood-glucose meter. </p>
<h1>What languages does Yonah speak?</h1>
<ul>
<li>English</li>
<li>Hebrew</li>
<li>Programming:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>/<a href="http://www.mysql.org">MySQL</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.java.com">Java</a>/<a href="http://www.javascript.org">JavaScript</a></li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1>That's nice, but why NJIT?</h1>
<p>A technical certificate, from a highly respected technical program (like NJIT's), solidifies my own knowledge of the
subject matter and prepares me for the next-level challenges. The knowledge I pick up in this program will probably be used
to become a Technical Project Lead or CIO.</p>
